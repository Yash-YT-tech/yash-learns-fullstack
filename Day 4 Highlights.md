# 📑 Sigma Web Dev Course — Day 4 (Tutorial #4) Summary

## 🛠 Project Setup
- Created project folder: **`video4`**  
- Files: `bookmatkmanager.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`  
- Built a **Bookmark Manager Website** 🚀  

## 🏗 HTML Structure
- Used **heading tags (`<h1>`–`<h6>`)** for content hierarchy  
  - `<h1>` → main title  
  - `<h2>`–`<h6>` → subheadings  
- Inserted **paragraphs** with `<p>`  
- Generated placeholder text using Emmet → `lorem <number>`

## 💻 VS Code Shortcuts
- **Emmet (`! + Enter`)** → boilerplate quickly  
- **Alt + Shift + ↓ (Down Arrow)** → duplicate lines  
- **Alt + Click** → multiple cursors for faster editing  

## 🔗 Anchor Tags
- Used `<a href="URL"> ... </a>` for links  
- Added `target="_blank"` to open in a **new tab**  
- Observed **visited vs unvisited link colors**  

## 🏷 Tags vs Attributes
- **Tags** define elements → e.g., `<p>`  
- **Attributes** add properties → e.g., `style="background:hotpink;"`  
- ❌ Inline styles discouraged → prefer CSS for maintainability  

## 📌 Extra Tip
- To make the **Bookmark file easily accessible**:  
  Right-click → **Open with** → Choose **Chrome as default**

## 📝 Personal Experience
On **Day 4**, I felt really confident because I built a **Bookmark Manager Website** from scratch.  
This project gave me hands-on practice with **HTML basics, attributes, and VS Code productivity hacks**.  
It felt exciting to actually make something useful where I can manage and access bookmarks directly in my own web page 🌐✨. 
It was very cool & don't thought that i would make my first website on the day 4 th . 
That's the Spiker for Me !
