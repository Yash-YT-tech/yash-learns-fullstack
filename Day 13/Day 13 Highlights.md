# 📝 Sigma Web Dev Course — Day 13 (Tutorial #13) Summary

---

## 🌟 Core Idea
- This tutorial **wraps up HTML fundamentals** and prepares us for **CSS styling and layouts**.  
- Focused on **entities, code display, quotations, and modern HTML best practices**.  
- Reinforces the principle of **structure vs presentation**: HTML for structure, CSS for styling.

---

## 🎯 Key Learning Concepts

### 🔤 HTML Entities and Special Characters
- Entities are **special codes** that display characters which might conflict with HTML or are hard to type.  
- **Common Examples:**  
  - `&lt;` → `<`  
  - `&gt;` → `>`  
  - `&amp;` → `&`  
  - `&quot;` → `"`  
  - `&copy;` → ©  
  - `&reg;` → ®  
  - `&nbsp;` → non-breaking space  

**Use Cases:**  
- Displaying HTML code as text without executing it.  
- Preserving multiple spaces in formatted content.

---

### 📝 Preformatted Text: `<pre>` Tag
- Maintains **whitespace, line breaks, and formatting** exactly as written.  
- Uses **monospace font** by default.  
- Ideal for displaying code snippets and structured text.  

---

### 💻 Code Display: `<code>` Tag
- Marks **computer code** inside HTML documents.  
- Can be used **inline** or combined with `<pre>` for multi-line code blocks.  
- Enhanced by tools like **Prism.js** for syntax highlighting and better visual presentation.

---

### 💬 Quotation Tags
- `<blockquote>` → Longer, block-level quotes, with optional `cite` attribute for source.  
- `<q>` → Short, inline quotes within text.  

**Benefits:**  
- Improves **SEO**, accessibility, and semantic meaning.  
- Allows **CSS styling flexibility**.  

---

### ⚠️ Deprecated HTML Tags to Avoid
- `<font>` → Obsolete for text styling; CSS now handles this.  
- `<center>` → Replaced by CSS techniques like Flexbox or Grid.  

**Key Principle:** Keep **structure in HTML** and **presentation in CSS**.

### 🌐 Additional Concepts
- **Character Sets:** UTF-8 recommended for international language support.  
- **Canvas Element:** HTML container for graphics, games, and data visualizations (controlled by JS).  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Always use **HTML entities** when displaying code or special characters.  
- Combine `<pre>` and `<code>` for proper code presentation.  
- Use semantic HTML for quotations and structured content.  
- Avoid obsolete tags and rely on **CSS for styling**.  
- Ensure broad compatibility and accessibility by using UTF-8 encoding and semantic practices.
