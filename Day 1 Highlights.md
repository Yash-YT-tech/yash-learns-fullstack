🌐 Day 1 – How the Web Works & Setting Up My Environment

💡 Understanding the Web:
Learned how a simple request travels from Client → Server → Response. Now I can clearly picture how a browser communicates with a server behind the scenes.

⚡ Frontend vs Backend:
Frontend = what we see (UI, design, user interaction).
Backend = what works behind (databases, logic, APIs).
This helped me connect the dots — websites are not just "design", they’re a mix of both.

🛠 VS Code Setup:
I already knew about VS Code. Installed the Live Server extension, which allows me to instantly preview my HTML pages in the browser without reloading again and again. 🚀

🔑 Key Takeaway:
On internet our devices & Server Commuincates for us , that cool !
