### 🔎 SEO Basics
- SEO = optimizing websites to appear higher in search engine results  
- Example: **Amazon loads fast → ranks higher**  
- Good SEO = quality content + technical optimization  

### 📊 Core Web Vitals
- 📏 **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** → measures unexpected page shifts  
  - Fix: Set explicit width & height for images  
- ⏱ **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** → time for main content to load (**< 2.5s is good**)  
- ⚡ **First Input Delay (FID)** → speed of first user interaction (**<100ms is good**)  

### 💻 Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)
- Generates reports on: **performance, SEO, accessibility, best practices**  
- Gives practical suggestions → compress images, set dimensions, improve load time  

### 🏷 SEO Elements in HTML
- `<title>` → should match actual page content  
- `<meta name="description">` → short page summary, helps ranking  
- `<meta keywords>` → outdated, mostly ignored  

### 📱 Responsive Design & Mobile Preview
- Used **Chrome DevTools’ device toolbar** to preview sites on mobile/tablets  
- Ensured websites are **responsive & adaptive** across all devices
