# ðŸŒŸ Day 32 Exercise Summary: Multicolor Website with CSS Variables   

## ðŸ“Œ Objective  
I practiced building a **multi-color website template** using **CSS Variables**. The goal was to create a site where switching themes only requires changing a few variables.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts Learned  
- **CSS Variables for Theming** â†’ Define colors once in `:root` and reuse them everywhere.  
- **Global Control** â†’ Updating a single variable updates the entire design.  
- **Theme Switching** â†’ Different classes (`.green`, `.blue`) override variable values.  
- **Reusable Layout** â†’ Navigation bar, background, and text colors adapt automatically.  
- **Minimal Code Changes** â†’ Only variables change, not the whole stylesheet.
